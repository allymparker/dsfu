    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>

    <p>
      <b
        >Supporting those who are risking everything helping the most vulnerable
        affected by the war in Ukraine</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We have established this new fund because we know of individuals who are
      striving to help others and who are out of reach of the established
      organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, one such person we seek to support is
      <a href="{{ '/team/yuliya' | relative_url }}">Yuliya</a>. She volunteers
      to help single parent households with children and young adults who have
      special needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >Through personal connections we identify those who are risking
        everything to help others, establish what is needed and then send money
        directly to help. No administration costs are incurred.</b
