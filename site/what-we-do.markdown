## OUR MISSION

Supporting those who are risking everything helping the most vulnerable affected by the war in Ukraine

We have established this new fund because we know of individuals who are striving to help others and who are out of reach of the established organisations.

For example, one such person we seek to support is Yuliya. She volunteers to help single parent households with children and young adults who have special needs.

Through personal connections we identify those who are risking everything to help others, establish what is needed and then send money directly to help.  No administration costs are incurred.


### HOW IT WORKS

Super speed  How do we achieve it?

Our aim is to get resources to the most needy as quickly as is humanly possible.
- Please send your donation via BACS to St Andrews Church Bank account.
- Money goes into Ukraine appeal section of St Andrews Church bank account.
- The team transfers money to the bank account of the person helping those affected by the war. This enables them to buy whatever is needed to help others
- The team receives feedback on the work undertaken within days (if communications permit) and publishes updates on this website

St Andrews will provide the back up, checks and balances to ensure the integrity of the use of the funds.

### ZERO ADMIN COSTS
All your donations are used to help the most vulnerable

- Those involved in the UK are volunteers and there are NO administration costs in the UK.
- Those rceiving the funds in Ukraine use all the funds given to support others.
