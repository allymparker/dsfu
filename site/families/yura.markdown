Yura is 14 years old. He has cerebral palsy and lives with his mum on the 3rd floor of an old building without an elevator. During the air raids his mum cannot carry him downstairs to the basement.  Since the war started, Yura spends most of his time in the corridor which has no windows.  This is the safest place to be as it is made of structural load bearing walls. Poltava, where they live, has been bombed many times.
