Vlad, age 18 has cerebral palsy and is very small for his age – only 110 cm tall; he is very skinny too.  Yet he smiles a lot. He lives with his mother in a house that doesn’t have running water and his mum has to get it from the well.   The food is cooked on a fire stove which mum needs to bring wood for.
