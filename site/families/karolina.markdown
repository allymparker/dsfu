Karolina, age 7, has cerebral palsy and a lot of issues with her knees. She has already had 3 operations. She used to live in Kyiv but when the bombing started, she and her mother moved to Fastov, a town not far from Kyiv. But even there, they had rockets flying over their heads and once it was so close, they thought that was the end. The rocket exploded at the nearby factory.
