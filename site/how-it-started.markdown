__From cancelled choir practice on the day the war started to a charity fund in just a month, this project evolved faster than we could have ever imagined.__

Day 1 of war. Thursday. On Feb 24, 2022, the day the war started in Ukraine, John Mullett, choir master at St Andrews Swavesey, felt moved to replace normal Thursday evening choir practice with 30 minutes of silence followed by Compline.

Shocked to learn that her native home town was hit by missile attack, Nataliya Moroz, whose parents still live near Kyiv, felt drawn to compline in St Andrews. “I was so overwhelmed by the distressing footage of so many familiar sights, the pain was just unbearable,” says Nataliya. “When I heard that St Andrews is doing something on the first day of the war, I dropped everything and went to the Compline”.

Day 4 of war. Sunday. Nataliya phoned Jacqui Fuller, St Andrews church warden, to ask if the church can become a central collection point of basics for Ukrainian refugees. There and then Jacqui agreed.

Nataliya was expecting to send maybe a single car load. The response from our little community was overwhelming. John got in contact with Nataliya… something about a conveyor :)
