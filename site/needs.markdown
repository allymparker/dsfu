Examples of the items that are urgently needed

- Adult nappies size S or M (Seny or Tena brands), some children use children size nappies (up to 30 kg)
- Disposable bed pads (90x60 or bigger), wet wipes
- Hygiene care products for bed ridden patients (nappy creams, gels for washing and shampoos)
- Food – both general (pureed baby food and formula) and specialized (protein mixes, gluten and dairy free products), juices, fruits
- General food – for both mothers and children.  Some of the children are able to eat basic food if it is blended.
- Physiotherapy - usually 10-14 days, requirements vary depending on diagnosis
- Medicines - mothers have to find and order medications themselves – these are often not provided by the state
- Basic sanitary hygiene products for mothers and their teenage daughters (sanitary pads, tampons)
- Clothing and shoes
- Wheelchairs and specialized care equipment (for example, loungers for bathtubs – to be able to give bath to a disabled teenager)
- Basic white goods (most mothers cannot afford to buy even most basic kitchen appliances – they live with broken or very old electric equipment; often top of the list are small freezers, fridges, blenders, juicers, or multicooker
- Notebooks and tablets/ipads - most children are bed ridden and one of the few things they can do is use technology to keep them stimulated.
