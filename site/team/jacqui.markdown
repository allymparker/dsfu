How St Andrew's Church got involved

<br>
<br>

{% include text-image.html right="true" image="jacqui/1.jpg" content="__THURSDAY THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY 2022__ was a shocking day for all those in the free world. It was the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The horror of what was happening became immediately obvious and our church community was soon asking how we could help. The service of prayer and compline was quickly established on Thursday evening by John Mullett and supported by the choir and members of the congregation.
However it wasn’t until I received a phone call on the Sunday evening, 27th February from Natalya saying that she would like to organize a collection of items which might be useful and could she use the church to act as a collection point that we really felt we could do something practical! We were thrilled to be asked and be able to help in some small way.
For those doubters social media can be a positive force of action. The word went out that we needed nappies, sanitary towels and tampons, new socks, pants, thermal underwear.

By lunchtime on the first day Monday twenty bags had arrived;"  %}

{% include text-image.html right="true" image="jacqui/3.jpg" content="Realizing that this project had really taken off John organised the loan of two roller conveyors and boxes from local firm Histon Produce and packing tapes and guns from Acorn Labels Ltd of St Ives to help to move everything and the word went out this time for helpers to come along on Friday." %}
{% include text-image.html image="jacqui/4.jpg" content="Over 50 adults, children, whole families turned up to help sort and box up all the items. It was a joy to see so many eager to help and we thank all of you from the sorters to the packers, those who made coffee and served cake, those who made boxes to those who labelled and sealed them. In remarkable time we had everything sorted ready to go on the Saturday morning." %}


# Impressions

There was a steady trickle of people who came to the church throughout the week each with a contribution of some sort and not just from the village either.
The president of the WI in Comberton had heard about it and organized a money collection from the members which she then spent on goods filling up her car twice over
Natalya’s daughter approached her school, Hills Road VI Form College to ask if anyone would like to contribute and they brought over a minibus full and an estate car full and ready boxed up for the collection. They even bought a box of chocolates for the volunteers to share.
