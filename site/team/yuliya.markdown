Yuliya Lamash is a volunteer supporting almost 60 children and young adults with severe disabilities who grow up in single parent households. These 6- to 19-year-olds suffer a number of medical conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy and genetic disorders. Almost all the children are bed ridden, need nappies every day, eat blended or specialized food, some of them also need a gluten free or a dairy free diet. The majority of them need medications to support them, physiotherapy and everyday care help as they cannot look after themselves. Many of these children are behind their peers in physical development, their weight and height are well below the average age standards. In all but one family, fathers are not present (mothers are raising children on their own).

One impact of the war has been that sponsors and other funding sources are no longer available. She needs our support to be able to buy the essential things the children need such as nappies, medicines, special nutritional foods and clothing.
