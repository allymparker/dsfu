​

St Andrew’s church, which sits on the edge of the village of Swavesey, has been so grateful for this opportunity to help the people of Ukraine. We are a small but friendly congregation worshipping every Sunday in our beautiful old building, ready to welcome anyone who would like to join us. The church is open everyday from nine until around sunset so if you would like to spend some time in private prayer, enjoy the wonderful architecture of the church or just sit quietly in its peaceful graveyard, please feel free to visit us.

​

Our address is:

Church End, Station Road, Swavesey

CB24 4QD.

There is on-site free parking and very close the guided busway Swavesey stop.

The church is open from 9:00 until around sunset." %}
